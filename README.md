**ðŸ“š Data Science Methodologies - CRISP-DM, KDD, SEMMA**


ðŸŒŸ Introduction
Welcome to the enchanting world of data science methodologies! This repository dives deep into three major methodologies that every data wizard should know: CRISP-DM, KDD, and SEMMA. Let's set sail on this journey of structured data analysis and discovery! 

**1. CRISP-DM**: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining
CRISP-DM is like the guiding star for data miners. It's a cyclical process that lights the way in our data journey:

1. **Business Understanding:** What are we trying to achieve? Define those goals!
2. **Data Understanding:** Dive into the data ocean and get familiar with the treasures within.
3. **Data Preparation :** Time for a cleanup! Get that data shiny and ready.
4. **Modeling :** Cast your spells (algorithms) to create some magical models.
5. **Evaluation:** How did we do? Check if the magic works as expected.
6. **Deployment:** Send your magic out into the world!


**2. KDD: Knowledge Discovery in Databases**


KDD is all about being a detective in the vast world of data:

1. **Selection :** Choose the data mysteries you want to solve.
2. **Preprocessing :** Clean and filter the data clues.
3. **Transformation :** Rearrange and reshape those clues.
4. **Data Mining :** Dig deep and find those hidden patterns!
5. **Interpretation/Evaluation :** What did we discover? Is it valuable?


**3. SEMMA: Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess**


SEMMA is like a telescope that helps us zoom in on the data universe:

1. **Sample :** Take a small slice of the vast data sky to examine.
2. **Explore :** Look around and understand what you're seeing.
3. **Modify:** Tweak and adjust to get a clearer view.
4. **Model:** Spot constellations (patterns) in the data stars.
5. **Assess:** How clear is our view? Are we seeing things right?
